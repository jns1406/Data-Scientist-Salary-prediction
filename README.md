After going through the dataset we are assuming the average salary is the target variable and we are trying to predict the target variable using various regression algorithms.\n

To perform regression we need to pre-process the data. Pre-processing of data includes:
• Handling missing values
• Handling outliers
• Feature scaling
• Feature selection (using corelation matrix)
• Handling categorical variables
After pre-processing we are splitting the data into train and test dataset(70:30 ratio).
